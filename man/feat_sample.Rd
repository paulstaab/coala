\title{Creates a feature that represents the sampling from one population}
\usage{
feat_sample(individuals, ploidy = 1, time = "0")
}
\arguments{
\item{individuals}{The number of individuals that are sampled per population,
given as a numeric vector.}

\item{ploidy}{The number of chromosomes that will be simulated per
individual.}

\item{time}{The time at which the sample is taken.}

\item{locus_group}{The loci for which this features is used. Can either be
\code{"all"} (default), in which case the feature is used for simulating
all loci, or a numeric vector. In the latter case, the feature is only
used for the loci added in \code{locus_} commands  with the corresponding
index starting from 1 in order in which the commands where added to the
model. For example, if a model has
\code{locus_single(10) + locus_averaged(10, 11) + locus_single(12)} and
this argument is \code{c(2, 3)}, than the feature is used for all but
the first locus (that is locus 2 - 12).}
}
\value{
The feature, which can be added to a model created with
\code{\link{coal_model}} using \code{+}.
